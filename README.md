This is a univeristy project I was working on for a bit.
In this project i learned how to use in Java :

                          - Processes
                          
                          - Threads
                          
                          - synchronization mechanisms like: ArrayBlockingQueues and other thread safe structures, atomic operations, volative variables etc. 
                          
Here is a short description:
  
  The topic "Queues Management Application using Threads and Synchronization Mechanisms" refers to the development of an application that simulates the behavior of a queue system, 
where clients arrive, wait in line, and are served by available servers. The application uses threads to manage the queues and synchronization mechanisms to ensure the correct behavior of the system.
The goal is to optimize the use of servers and minimize the waiting time for clients.
